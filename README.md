#Troll Patrol

The prupose of troll patrol's website is to have a place where troll patrol members can share their twitch streams and interact with both fellow troll patrolers and also the rest of the twitch community!

The website is currently in early development and uses node.js servers with express routing and handlebars as the viewport. 

If you would like to get involved in either the coding aspect of the website, the design aspect of the website or you have ideas for cool functionality that you would like to see implemented feel free to reach out to me, tohper or sandwhich.. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



From a functionality perspective this is what we were looking for the website to accomplish:

LANDING PAGE:

  - On the landing page of the website you will see a twitch live embeded video player and the accompied embeded chat player. 
  - The landing page will also display general information on the spotlighted twitch streamer at the moment.
  - There will also be a small section for troll patrol related FAQ's (like how do i get involved with troll patrol)
  - Links to all troll patrols social platforms
  
  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
  
As you might be able to tell from the above landing page, the main goal of the troll patrol website is to 

1.) promote troll patrol community members
2.) provide a central location to see what troll patrol is up to

With that being said, troll patrol will let anyone stream on our website as long as they have been approved by Troll Patrol founding members / the community itself.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USER DASHBOARD:

You can sign up on the website to get access to the dashboard.

The dashboard will have multiple "Tier" levels that will display custom content depending on the status of the user.

Newbie account status will have access to the basic dashboard.
Streamer account status will have access to streamer controls which will allow them to stream from the main landing page (once they have been verified).

Ultimatly there will be a system set up in which authorized streamsers can schedule amungst themselved who gets to stream on the main page and eventually you can cycle through all the avilible troll patrol authorezed streamers via something like a carousel. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any additional ideas for functionality or content on the website will be heavily considered! 

If you have ideas write them down similar to how I described above and if you have the time draw up wireframs like this!
